        <h1>Welcome to my blog :)</h1>
        <post id="0"><post-header>
    <h2>This is a hello!</h2>
</post-header>
<p>And to be honest, there is not much to see here yet. This new system design (which includes the UI) is
    replacing the previous WordPress backend.</p>
<p>More interestingly, this is now being hosted on a local 6-node Kubernetes cluster (3 physical nodes, 2
    virtual machines each). At some point, I intend on re-adding the Kubernetes cluster status page.</p>
<p>As an added bonus, this blog is now being deployed as part of a GitHub Action via a Tailscale connection to the cluster,
    which builds an image and pings the Kubernetes cluster to re-deploy the blog whenever there is a change.
</p>
<p>Posts now get version control, as well as this blog using a far lighter backend (no database or PHP). It is also still sufficiently simple to publish posts compared to WP on my part. What's not to love?</p>
<p>Anyways, that's all I had to say - please enjoy the following photo I took while I was in Tokyo in 2024:</p>

    alt="Tokyo Skytree, around 10:30 PM JST. Dark skies, warm city lights, narrow streets and Sensō-ji temple in view. The Tokyo Skytree is a structure that starts with a base and thins out towards the top, has two observation decks two thirds of the way to the top and is lit in red and white LED colours across the tower." />

<br />
<p>Until next time!</p>
